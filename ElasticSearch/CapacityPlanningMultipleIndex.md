**Use Case**
> Consider a use case, where we have heartbeat getting ingested every 20 second to elastic search. Lets say,
> we have 400K concurrent user sending heartbeats, where each heartbeat is of size 1200  bytes. We are 
>ingesting some quality metrics to ElasticSearch in two indices - 1) short_interval*, 2)long_interval*. We want to
>do proper capacity planning for our ElasticSearch cluster. 

**Storage Requirement**
```
        Heartbeat Arrival       = 20s
        Heartbeat Size          = 1200 bytes
        Concurrent Users        = 400000
        Concurrent Request/Sec  = Concurrent Users/Heartbeat Arrival = 400000/20 = 20000
        Daily Total Request     = Concurrent Request/Sec *60*60*24 = 20000*60*60*24 = 1728*10^6
        Daily Source Data       = Heartbeat Size * Daily Total Request = 1200 * 1728 * 10^6 / 10^9 GB = 2073.6 GB
        Replica                 = 1

## Capacity Planning without ultrawarm Multiple index

**Index 1**
```
        Retention Period        = 30
        Primary Shard Count     = Math.Ceiling((Daily Source Data * 1.25)/50 GB) [**(III)** ] = 52
        Active Shards           = Primary Shard Count * (1+ Replica) [**(V)**] = 52 ( 1+1) = 104
        Min. Storage Required   = Daily Source Data * (1 + Replica) * Retention Period [**(I)**] = 2073.6*(1+1)*30 = 124416 GB 
        [Considering r5.4xlarge]
        No. Instances based on Storage      = Math.CEILING(Min. Storage Required / EBS Volume **[VI]**)/3 (each document of an interval is updated atmost thrice) = Math.CEILING(124416/6000/3) = 7 ..(IX)
        No. Instances based on CPU Required = Math.CEILING(Active Shards * Shard vs CPU [**(IV)**]/VCPU Per Instance [**(VII)**)) = 10   ..(X)

        Considering (IX) && (X), we should have 10 instances of R5.4xlarge instances. 

        as per (V*) number of active shards should be divisible by number of instances to make sure no data skewness.
        So, active shards/No. Instances based on Storage = 104/21 = Not Divisible, 
        Hence, we consider 24 instances with 120 active shards (24*5). This will let us have 120/(1+Replica)= 120/2=60 primary shards,
        where each shard will be of (Daily Source Data * 1.25)/Primary Shard Count = (2073.6*1.25)60 = 43GB , that would let us have a growth in shard size(50FB) as well
       
        As recommended to use 3 availability zone, each zone will have 24/3 = 8 instances.

        **Cost Calculation...Monthly**
        Cost for R5.4xlarge instances = 24*HourlyRate*24*30 = 24*1.487*24*30 = **25695.36** ....(XI)
        
        
```

**Index 2**

        Primary Shard Count     = Math.Ceiling((Daily Source Data * 1.25)/50 GB) [**(III)** ] = 52
        Active Shards           = Primary Shard Count * (1+ Replica) [**(V)**] = 52 ( 1+1) = 104
        Min. Storage Required   = Daily Source Data * (1 + Replica) * Retention Period [**(I)**] = 2073.6*(1+1)*365 = 1513728 GB 
        [Considering r5.4xlarge]
        No. Instances based on Storage      = Math.CEILING(Min. Storage Required / EBS Volume **[VI]**)/3(each document  is updated thrice) = Math.CEILING(1513728/6000/3) = 85 ..(IX)
        No. Instances based on CPU Required = Math.CEILING(Active Shards * Shard vs CPU [**(IV)**]/VCPU Per Instance [**(VII)**)) = 10   ..(X)

        Considering (IX) && (X), we should have 85 instances of R5.4xlarge instances. 


        As recommended to use 3 availability zone, each zone will have 85/3 = 29 instances per zone [85 in one zone]

        **Cost Calculation...Monthly**
        Cost for R5.4xlarge instances = 85*HourlyRate*24*30 = 85*1.487*24*30 = **91004** ....(XI)
